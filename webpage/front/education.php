        <h4>University Semester Abroad, 2014/2015</h4>
        <h5>Exchange program, California State University Fullerton, California, USA</h5>
        During the year in California I learned how it is to live in a different culture and talk another language every day. During the time at CSUF I studied mostly economics and finance in order to get an understanding about the society around us and the companies I will work for in the future.
